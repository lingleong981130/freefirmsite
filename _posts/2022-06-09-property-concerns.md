Why Do I Need a Will if Everything Automatically Goes to My Spouse and Children?

Does it, though?

Texas is a Community Property state. To understand this, let's first define a couple of terms:

* **Community Property** - This is everything purchased and acquired (except by gift or devise) during the marriage.

* **Separate Property** - This is anything purchased and acquired before the marriage and any gifts or inheritances received at any time (before or during the marriage) (Think oil royalties from your late great aunt, proceeds from the sale of your late mother’s home).

If you die without a will in Texas, the Texas Estates Code decides which of your heirs receives your Separate Property and Community Property (Hint: not everything automatically passes to your spouse or children.)

## Surprising Scenarios

### Traditional Nuclear Family

If you are married and all children are also children of your surviving spouse, your half of the Community Property goes to your surviving spouse. 

With Separate Property, however, the picture is different.

Your surviving spouse only gets a third of your Separate Property, and your children will get the *remaining two thirds*. Separate Real Property is even more complicated – your surviving spouse receives a life estate in one third of the property and your children take the remainder. 

In the real world, this can be a complicated and often undesirable situation.

### Blended Family
If you are married and some of your children are not children of your surviving spouse, your half of the Community Property goes to your children, **not** to your surviving spouse.

### Married Without Children
If you are married and have no children, all your personal property goes to your surviving spouse. Your real property, however, is split, giving half to your surviving spouse and half divided among your parents and/or siblings (depending on which parents and siblings survive you).

### Unmarried Parents
This one is the simplest. 

If you are unmarried and have children, all of your property goes to your children.

### Unmarried Without Children
If you are unmarried and have no children, all of your property goes to your parents and/or siblings (depending on which parents and siblings survive you).

## Conclusion
If any of these scenarios surprise you, and you would rather have control over how your property is distributed, call [832-324-9469](tel:832-324-9469) today to discuss your options.
